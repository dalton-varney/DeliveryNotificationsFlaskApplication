# DeliveryNotificationsFlaskApplication

## Greetings all

This is the flask app and corresponding video files for the delivery notifications demo. 
I used JS and socketio to pass strings between the app.py and flask for a notification style alert. 
Keep in mind this application is a bit bloated because it combines multiple flask applications and functionality from previous demos as well, including:
alwaysAI-style main page
Data collection that exports PASCALVOC .zip
Multiple streaming videos
